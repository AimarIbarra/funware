# puzzle
Shuffles the names of all the files in your current working directory recursively.

## Running
It is a simple python script with no third party dependencies.

## Note
It previously shuffles the files of the home directory, however I accidentally run it and had to fix it.
So, in order to avoid my clumsyness to shuffle my files again, now it is limited to the current working directory.
